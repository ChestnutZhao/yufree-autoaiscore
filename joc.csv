Photoactivation of Thianthrenium Salts: An Electron-Donor–Acceptor (EDA)-Complex Approach,"Thianthrenium salts have emerged as one of the most versatile reagents, gaining significant popularity within the synthetic community for their utility in the construction of C–C and C–X (X = N, O, S, P, halogens) bonds. The use of photoredox and transition metal catalysis with thianthrenium salts for C–C and C–heteroatom bond formation is well established. However, most of these methods require elevated temperatures, expensive catalysts, and ligands under stringent conditions for effective execution. In contrast, the photocatalysis- and transition-metal-free approaches for constructing C–C and C–X bonds using thianthrenium salt derivatives have become increasingly sought after. In this regard, electron-donor–acceptor (EDA)-complex reactions have emerged as a powerful strategy in organic synthesis, eliminating the need for photocatalysts under visible light irradiation. EDA-complex photochemistry exploits the electron-acceptor properties of thianthrenium salts, facilitating the rapid generation of radical intermediates via the C–S bond cleavage. These radical intermediates play a pivotal role in enabling a variety of valuable C–C and C–X formations. In this Perspective, we highlight significant advances in the EDA-complex-mediated reactions involving thianthrenium salts with mechanisms, substrate scope, and limitations for constructing C–C and C–heteroatom bonds. For the sake of brevity, the article is organized into five main sections: (1) Nitrogen-based donor reactions, (2) Oxygen-based donor reactions, (3) Sulfur-based donor reactions, (4) Phosphorus-based donor reactions, and (5) π-based donor reactions, with a focus on C–C, C–S, C–B and C–P bond formations.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.5c00194
"Construction of 3-Nitro-1H-pyrazole-5-yl-Bridged/Fused 4,5-Diamino-4H–1,2,4-triazoles Achieving High-Energy Insensitive Energetic Materials","Aminotriazole is a privileged structural motif in the design of various thermostable and insensitive energetic materials. A series of 3-nitro-1H-pyrazole-5-yl-bridged/fused 4,5-diamino-4H–1,2,4-triazoles was prepared via the cycloaddition of carboxyl pyrazole as a raw material. These newly synthesized compounds and their corresponding salts were fully characterized by chemical analysis (single-crystal X-ray diffraction, infrared, NMR, and mass spectroscopy) as well as experimental tests (thermostability and sensitivities). Their detonation properties (detonation velocity, detonation pressure, etc.) were determined with the EXPLO5 program on the basis of crystal density and calculated heat of formation with the Gaussian 09 suite. These pyrazole-triazoles show very high thermostabilities (Td?> 320 °C) and low mechanical sensitivities (IS ≥ 25 J, FS ≥ 288 N) due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions in polycyclic triazoles. In particular, tricyclic?3a?displays an ultrahigh decomposition temperature of 371 °C, surpassing that of 2,2’,4,4’,6,6’-hexanitrostilbene (HNS) and can be used as a candidate for heat-resistant explosives. Dinitroamino compounds?2?(PCJ?= 38.58 GPa,?Vdet?= 9268 m s–1) and?2d?(PCJ?= 36.15 GPa,?Vdet?= 8913 m s–1) were found to show excellent detonation performance, with?2?being comparable to 1,3,4,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocane (HMX). Furthermore, compound?1?exhibits desirable detonation properties (PCJ?= 34.74 GPa,?Vdet?= 9284 m s–1), high thermostability (333 °C), and low sensitivities (IS > 40 J, FS > 360 N), making it a promising HMX replacement. This study supports the superiority of utilizing the polycyclic pyrazole-triazole system in the development of new high-energy insensitive energetic materials.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.4c02633
The Studies on the Synthesizing Dibenzodiazocinediimine via Constructing an Eight-Membered Ring,"A one-step and facile strategy to synthesize dibenzo[b,f][1,5]diazocine-6,12(5H,11H)-diimine and its analogs via the construction of an eight-membered ring has been established using?o-aminobenzonitrile or?o-phenylenediamine/phthalonitrile derivatives as raw materials. Twelve compounds, including 9 new compounds, have been synthesized in yields ranging from 62–95%. Five new compounds of 5,12-dihydrodibenzo[b,f][1,4]diazocine-6,11-diimine derivatives have also been synthesized in yields of 35–52%. Furthermore, the reaction between arylnitriles and various amines was also efficiently established under similar reaction conditions. Finally, a reasonable mechanism involving sodium as a proper base to initiate the cyclization process was proposed.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.4c02912
The Stereochemical Outcome of Galactosylations Is Influenced by Both the Position and Electron-Withdrawing Power of Distal Acyl Protecting Groups,"The stereodirecting effect of various distal benzoyl esters on the anomeric selectivity in galactopyranosylations was investigated. It was found that esters on O-6 of galactosyl donors of the phenyl thioglycoside type had a negligible influence on the anomeric selectivity. Instead, α-selective galactosylations were observed with 4-O-benzoyl, 3,4-di-O-benzoyl, and 4,6-di-O-benzoyl protected galactosyl donors, with the highly electron-withdrawing?p-nitrobenzoyl (pNO2Bz) protecting group providing the most α-selective galactosylations. Furthermore, the α-selectivity was enhanced by replacing the thiophenyl aglycon functionality with the highly reactive cyclohexyl aglycon functionality. These findings enabled the successful synthesis of the biologically relevant α-d-Gal(1→4)Gal linkage. The obtained results do not suggest distal participation as a course for the observed anomeric selectivities.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.4c02956
"Electrochemically Promoted Synthesis of?N-Sulfonyl Sulfinimidate Esters and Sulfilimines from Sulfonamides, Thiophenols, Thioethers, and Alcohols","In this work, we report an electrochemical method for the straightforward preparation of scarcely accessible sulfinimidate esters from readily available sulfonamides, thiophenols, and alcohols. Mechanistic experiments show that sulfur oxidation at the anodic surface generates an electrophilic intermediate, which subsequently undergoes nucleophilic substitution. Moreover, sulfilimines can be obtained in moderate-to-excellent yields when thioethers are used as the S-donor instead of thiophenols via a dehydrogenateive imination process. This method is also characterized by mild reaction condition, operational simplicity, high atomic economic efficiency, easy later drug synthesis, and modification, as well as scaling up to a gram scale.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.5c00050
