Regioselective prenylation of chalcones by a fungal prenyltransferase (AtaPT),"Prenylation by prenyltransferases exhibits remarkable potential for chalcone modification owing to its high efficiency, specificity, and environmental benignity. The fungal-derived prenyltransferase AtaPT along with prenyl donors of different chain lengths was utilized in this study and five new prenylated chalcones (1G1,?1G2,?2G,?2D1, and?2D2) were chemoenzymatically synthesized. Notably, all prenyl groups were selectively incorporated into ring B of the chalcone scaffold, clearly demonstrating the exquisite regioselectivity of AtaPT. This work not only significantly expands the structural diversity of prenylated chalcones but also provides a biosynthetic module for the green and efficient preparation of prenylated chalcones in synthetic biology.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tetlet.2025.155649
Electrocatalytic intramolecular cross-dehydrogenative coupling for synthesis of fused heterocyclic compounds bearing tetrahydroisoquinoline core,"An intramolecular cross-dehydrogenative coupling of N-aryl substituted tetrahydroisoquinolines under electrooxidation condition was developed. The addition of TEMPO and BINOL-derived phosphoric acids allowed the reaction to proceed at low electrode potentials and without the need of additional oxidizers and metals. The corresponding fused heterocyclic products were obtained in good to excellent yields under mild conditions. In addition, the catalysis of chiral 3,3-triazolyl BINOL-derived phosphoric acids enabled this coupling reaction in moderate enantioselectivity.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tetlet.2025.155646
Ag-promoted radical decarboxylative annulation of ¦Á-keto acids with terminal alkynes to construct Indenones,"An Ag-promoted radical decarboxylative annulation of ¦Á-keto acids with terminal alkynes to provide C2 benzoylated indenones is realized, via radical decarboxylation, addition and cyclization cascade. Terminal alkynes were used directly as the substrate with excellent reigo-selectivity. The second benzoyl radical was installed onto the C2 of indeonone, benefiting the potential post-functionalization.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tetlet.2025.155648
Base-promoted hydrophosphination of?in situ?formed aza-ortho-quinone methides for the preparation of 2-aminobenzyl phosphorus oxides,"A base-promoted 1,4-hydrophosphination of?in situ?generated aza-ortho-quinone methides (aza-o-QMs) from?N-(ortho-chloromethyl)aryl amides was reported in this work. Diarylphosphine oxides and phosphites serve as efficient P-nucleophiles in these reactions. The advantages of this method include a broad substrate scope, operational simplicity, mild conditions, and high yields, providing an alternative strategy for synthesizing various 2-aminobenzyl phosphorus oxides.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tetlet.2025.155658
"Asymmetric approach to aromatic bisabolanes via allylic diazene rearrangement (ADR): Total syntheses of (?)-curcumene, (?)-dihydrocurcumene, (?)-nuciferol, and (?)-nuciferal","Concise asymmetric approach to the total synthesis of naturally occurring sesquiterpenes have been achieved via a key allylic diazene arrangement (ADR) from a naturally occurring bisabolane sesquiterpenoid, 6-hydroxy-2-methyl-5-(5¡¯-hydroxy-1¡¯(R),5¡¯-dimethyl-hex-3¡¯-enyl)-phenol (4) isolated from the resins of?Commiphora kuaa?(Burseraceae). The ADR goes through a Mitsunobu reaction with?o-nitro benzene sulfonyl hydrazide followed by the decomposition of sulfonyl hydrazide adduct following a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement via the extrusion of?o-nitro benzene sulfinic acid and nitrogen gas. This strategy has been utilized for an efficient colelctive total synthesis of naturally occurring sesquiterpenoids, (?)-curcumene (1a), (?)-dihydrocurcumene (1b), (?)-nuciferol (1c) and (?)-nuciferal (1d).",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tetlet.2025.155656
