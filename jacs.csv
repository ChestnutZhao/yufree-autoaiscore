Synthesis of High-Entropy Alloy Polyhedra Using Liquid Metal Dewetting,"High-entropy alloys (HEAs) are gaining extensive interest in materials science, and their facet engineering has long been a pursuit for materials design and advanced applications. However, limited by the poor compatibility of crystal face regulation in high-entropy scenarios with the existing extreme-condition synthetic techniques, the synthesis of HEA polyhedra is still scarce and challenging. Herein, we propose the strategy of liquid-metal-participating biphasic-modulated dewetting for self-confinement growth under near-equilibrium conditions. Owing to the surface energy anisotropy, HEAs could develop into the equilibrium shape with a polyhedral configuration, where liquid metal endows fast diffusion toward reaching the equilibrium shape. This strategy could also be extended to diverse HEA polyhedra with different chemical compositions and crystal structures with the formation mechanism elucidated through in situ transmission electron microscopy experiments and theoretical calculations. This work injects new vitality into the regulation of HEAs and expedites their facet engineering.",https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c02254
Dehomologative C–C Borylation of Aldehydes and Alcohols via a Rh-Catalyzed Dehydroformylation–Borylation Relay,"The dehomologative conversion of linear or α-methyl aldehydes to vinyl boronates is achieved via a one-pot sequence of rhodium-catalyzed transfer dehydroformylation and transfer borylation of the resulting alkenes. Similarly, allylic or aliphatic alcohols are converted to vinyl boronates through a sequence involving, respectively, rhodium-catalyzed isomerization or transfer dehydrogenation to aldehyde intermediates, followed by dehydroformylation–borylation. The vinyl boronates can be further hydrogenated to alkyl boronates using the same rhodium precatalyst, enabling all five catalytic steps with a single catalyst system.",https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c02181
Phase Engineering of 1T′-MoS2?via Organic Enwrapment,"Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is a layered material known to show various phases. Most studies on it have focused on its semiconductor phase, but it is known to also have a metallic 1T′ phase. This 1T′ phase has also drawn attention as a quantum spin Hall phase, but the 1T′ phase is metastable, and methods for transforming or stabilizing it are still challenging. This Communication demonstrates a method for effectively transforming the monolayer or the topmost layer of multilayer semiconductor MoS2?(the 1H or 2H phase) into the 1T′ phase via ultraviolet-ozone (UVO) treatment, followed by polymer enwrapment of the MoS2?surface. UVO induces the transformation of the 1H (2H) phase into the 1T′ phase, but the generated phase is unstable. The enwrapment procedure with the polymer poly-l-lysine was found to be effective in transforming the 1H (2H) phase into the 1T′ phase and stabilizing it. Moreover, this procedure transformed only the topmost layer and generated a vertical 1T′/2H heterostructure in multilayer cases. This study shows the high potential of surface organic chemical procedures to control the phases in 2D transition metal dichalcogenides.",https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c02099
From Reagent to Catalyst: Dispersion-Driven Design of a General Asymmetric Transfer Hydrogenation Catalyst,"Even though chemists have long underappreciated the role of London dispersion in catalysis, its importance in determining a reaction course is now well recognized. Dispersion interactions have been shown to stabilize transition states and govern the stereoselectivity. In this context, the transfer hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes reported by our group via asymmetric counteranion-directed catalysis (ACDC) was revisited mechanistically. Previously, the use of an engineered Hantzsch ester featuring an isopropyl group was crucial for high enantioselectivity, suggesting London dispersion as an important stereocontrolling factor. Based on this hypothesis and the method’s drawbacks (commercially unavailable Hantzsch ester, limited substrate scope, high catalyst loadings), we designed a broadly applicable second-generation catalyst system by introducing dispersion energy donors into the catalyst instead of the Hantzsch ester reagent. With the help of computational analysis, noncovalent interactions contributing to stereocontrol in the two systems were elucidated.",https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c00641
Cage Alkyl Carbenes Provide Experimental Evidence for Isotope-Controlled Selectivity in Competing Tunneling Reactions,"We report the synthesis and reactivity of adamantylidene (1) and pentacyclo[5.4.0.02,6.03,10.05,9]undecanylidene (2) under matrix isolation conditions. The latter previously unreported carbene is persistent under cryogenic conditions and has been characterized spectroscopically. The singlet carbenes were generated through irradiation of their corresponding diazirine precursors followed by trapping the products in argon or nitrogen matrices at 3.5 K. Analyses using IR and UV/vis spectroscopy together with density functional theory computations provide strong evidence for the successful preparation of these reactive species. Carbene?1?(ΔEST?= ?3.0 kcal mol–1) undergoes a slow hitherto unreported but theoretically predicted quantum mechanical tunneling (QMT) C–H-bond insertion and ring-closure to 2,4-dehydroadamantane (4). In contrast,?2?(ΔEST?= ?5.2 kcal mol–1) remains unchanged under cryogenic conditions but rearranges to homohypostrophene (9) upon λ = 627 nm irradiation. Attempts to prepare protoadamantylidene (3) (ΔEST?= ?5.1 kcal mol–1) in a similar fashion did not allow the direct observation of the free carbene, but enabled follow-up QMT reactions, whose selectivities are determined by the?1H and?2H isotopologs, thereby demonstrating isotope-controlled selectivity (ICS).",https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.4c18129
